Transcript expression meta-analysis
===================================

.. meta_analysis:

BioTK provides a way to store up to millions of expression vectors, along with
associated probe mappings and phenotype/sample data, in HDF5 format on your
hard drive for efficient querying and meta-analysis. HDF5 has many benefits,
including query efficiency and the ability to store all your expression data
in a single file that can be easily backed up or transferred to different
computers.

If you like, you can easily store and query all available GEO samples for your
model organism(s) of choice.
